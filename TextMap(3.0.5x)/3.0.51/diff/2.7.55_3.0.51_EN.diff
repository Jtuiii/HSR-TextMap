+"Due to the influence of History Fictionologists, the end of #Rubert II has always remained enigmatic. Some references wrote that the second emperor's organic body ultimately hindered him from completing the empire's great work, as he died from illness on the cast-iron throne. Some poets warbled that a lady in a pastel-colored silk dress sauntered into the capital, and the empire collapsed in a cacophony. Other voices lamented that the metallic ring pricked his finger, and so the riotous machine killed the organic before him. Some plays also dramatized that he suddenly expressed his profound feelings and shed human tears as if he suddenly became free, then slowly closed his eyes before his subjects, never to open them again."

In the gloomy and depressing mining caves, the survivors fall shiveringly asleep and head into dreams to find the freedom they could not find in reality, just like how it was like in yesteryear in the Land of the Dreams."

+"The Kolchis established an extremely prosperous sunset dynasty in the rainforest approximately one thousand Amber Eras ago. However, they disappeared within ten Amber Eras after the beginning of the Ice Age. The fate of the Kolchis became a myth that plagued historians for many years due to how bodies of this race have never been unearthed — until a group of hothead daredevils following Trailblaze collapsed the species' subterranean royal mausoleum with dynamite. These Nameless, trapped in the underground passage, discovered an edible algae species and held on until help arrived thanks to consuming this algae. That was how these delectable algae were introduced to the stars — when people realized that these algae were nothing less than the Kolchis, this moss ball became labeled as an invasive species on more than fifty planets."

+"Few creatures can survive in Talia's sandstorms, and Barzarton lizards are one of them. They consume the highly radioactive ores on the planet as food and convert it as energy needed for survival. Their excessive energy and aggressiveness make Barzarton lizards demonstrate capacities far beyond that of ordinary vehicles. Some deceptive businesspeople even named the species \"Destructive Mega Lizard,\" hoping to sell it to newbie Annihilation Gang members for a high price on the black market. As the open-air mines gradually became depleted, more Barzarton lizards learned to carry their young to the land of the Wastelanders to ensure the offspring's survival. That was how Talia's lizard breeding industry was born."

The intense difficulty involved in cooking their meat meant they became an ingredient that frequently appeared in high-end culinary establishments. Based on observations by the Astral Ecology School, these creatures have significant genetic similarities with the Cnidaria organisms in Muldrasil. There are even radicals who claim that these animals share a common ancestor with the wingweavers, but this idea faced universal rebuttal from the Interastral Culinary Association."

Oswaldo has jokingly stated more than once that the means employed by the Building Material Logistics Department are far more radical than those used by the Marketing Development Department, and that might well be the truth."

If the Aeons truly stand above all lifeforms and rule supreme, then why would they care about the everyday concerns of mortals? The existence of the sleeping and shapeless IX is proof of that. To show the Self-Annihilators that the Aeons do care, the Doctors of Chaos combined the demon god crafts of the occult monks to create the Sealing Wax of Aeons. It is said that stamping with this Sealing Wax will attract a glimpse from the corresponding Aeon from across space and time — There are no successful examples yet, but some Self-Annihilators did regain their faith in the universe, Aeons, and everything else after stamping with this sealing wax."

The meddlesome Masked Fools gained inspiration from this misunderstanding and imitated the concept of the Gold Coins of Discord to create a credit tree, spreading the seeds far and wide.

They could simulate the physical form of native citizens and connect to the senses of their controller to allow the trailblazing journey to continue through even the harshest environments through long-distance operations. Due to their lack of realism, clay doll exploration was quickly abandoned by the Nameless, but this technology became a huge boom in the field of interstellar tourism, allowing the IPC to make massive profits."

+"Once, an aggressive fool questioned the believers in Aidonia, unbelieving as to how there could be a religion in Amphoreus that reveres death. \"If you love {RUBY_B#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} so much, why not just pierce your own chest with a spear?\"\\n\\nThe Aidonians regarded the man with disdain, saying, \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\"\\n\\nSince its founding, Aidonia has been a holy site that valued life the most within Amphoreus. The followers of {RUBY_B#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} believe that the River of Souls' waters are cold enough to chill the bones — only those who have walked the earth long enough and have endured countless hardships can cross its icy abyss and face {RUBY_E#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. To seek the blessing of Death is not to disregard life.\\n\\nFor this reason, though the Aidonians considered death as a homecoming and gave birth to many fearsome warriors, they have never sought to conquer the fertile lands to the south — For those lands do not forge strong souls, and the Aidonians disdain the softness of comfort.\\n\\nAsceticism is a unique cultural hallmark of the Aidonians. Every year, when the snow subsides and the rare days of clear skies appear, they celebrate the Bone Collection Festival. Priests of Aidonia leave the city in search of animal bones buried in the wastelands and swamps. The most sacred offerings come from the remains of prehistoric beasts, long dead since many Light Calendar years ago. When their bones are struck, a deep echo seems to carry the faint whisper of {RUBY_B#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The animal bones, cold as if soaked in the freezing ice of the River of Souls, are transported back to the city one by one. The slightly broken ones get processed and become ornaments, to be worn by the people day and night. The best-preserved bones, on the other hand, are carefully polished by the priests into ceremonial bone swords for burials, offered as gifts during the festival.\\n\\nOne year, during the Bone Collection Festival, the Aidonians encountered that girl in the wasteland. Soon, rumors spread that \"her touch could allow one to cross the barrier of the River of Souls and directly face death.\"\\n\\nDevotees of Death flocked to the temple to meet the emissary of {RUBY_E#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}. The Aidonian priests, sensing that the girl threatened their faith, consecrated her as the Maiden of War, forbidding commoners from approaching her. Only those ascetics who had endured the trials of the world and revered both life and death were allowed to be embraced by her, and through her hand return their souls to the afterlife. The girl donned the long robes prepared by the priests, executed her ritual with her bare hands, and buried humankind with her embrace.\\n\\nThe Aidonians genuinely believe that \"The River of Souls never ferries souls that are barren.\" Yet, the River of Souls does not question the weight of the soul. It simply flows, leading all life to its inevitable end, where all souls converge."

@@ -97898223 @@
+"Aidonia — the snow-dusted kingdom of death — once stood tall amidst the blizzards, and now remains silent beneath them.\\n\\nAlmost all humankind enjoyed the pleasures of eternal life in the spring-filled lands in the endless Era Chrysea, yet a few souls grew weary of the countless cycles of day and night and decided to seek the end of life. \"Why does life exist? And where should it go?\" Eleusis, the leader of the Ascetics, advanced north with his followers as he muttered this eternal question, seeking a sweet and frozen long dream. The robed ascetics settled in the desolate northern wasteland, building a solemn city-state where snow fell relentlessly all year round — A place later known as \"Aidonia.\"\\n\\nHow the Era Chrysea ended had long been lost to the annals of history, but the \"First Dead\" in Amphoreus was said to have come from Aidonia. That person received the gift of death from {RUBY_B# the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} — both a merciful blessing and the highest of honors.\\n\\nThe people of Aidonia were long accustomed to the harsh and lethal cold. The snow itself, long steeped in the silent faith of {RUBY_B#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#}, also greedily absorbed the warmth of life as it soon touched the earth. Long ago, travelers entering Aidonia's demesne would often find anonymous frozen bodies lying dead by the roadside, unfortunates who had returned to the embrace of the {RUBY_B#Death Titan}Hand of Shadow{RUBY_E#}. The north wind howled, and the dead became markers on the road, guiding and warning those who journeyed through the snow. Travelers always hurried through Aidonia while the breath of life remained within them.\\n\\nIn time, the Aidonians came upon gravestones of mourning standing tall in the barren land, realizing that someone was offering their blessings to the cycle of death and the passing of life.\\n\\nBeneath the gravestone slumbers an unknown girl. A zone of death surrounds her like a shadowy shroud, and even the skeletarasses that inhaled the breath of death withered away around her form. The Aidonians sensed the merciful touch of {RUBY_B#the Death Titan}Thanatos{RUBY_E#} on her and welcomed her back to the city as their Holy Maiden. The faithful followers of the Death Titan, in reverence, emulated her, erecting towering gravestones in the wastelands to mark the end of long journeys and life's return to death — For life and death are both journeys, and this land only maintains boundary stones that recorded the paths taken.\\n\\nThe gravestones were warning distant travelers that no one stayed there and no one rested there... The dead, too, are travelers. They are the north wind, the falling snow, and the countless threads that connect them."

The downside was that these objects that appeared from nowhere would cause surrounding materials to expand at an almost infinite rate and cause violent explosions, making them unfit for use in any spaceship.

As expected, this great invention was met with abysmal sales. Evidently, pre-school education as conceived by Puzzle was quite different from the general public's perception of it.

Following this logic, restlessly constructing the foundation of walls on the surface of every planet is counter-productive, and the true calling of an Architect is to seal any potential disasters within high walls for protection preemptively. The awkward thing is that no monsters are foolish enough to simply stand in place and wait for a cage to be constructed.

They harnessed the power of their star system and created an entropy-destroying machine, so as to challenge the laws of the Supreme Destroyer.

The continuous evolution of the Warhead's own physical capabilities is the external representation of this parasite's evolution.

+"Each thought of the Grove of Epiphany is like a branch on the giant tree. The veins form hundreds of viewpoints, expanding like an intricate web of young boughs. Though independent, they intertwine, ultimately forming the thriving canopy of the great tree.\\n\\nOne branch pointed its leaf stalk toward itself, twisting in intricate coils. The Ascetics of Lotophagism were captivated by the very patterns of the tree's leaves and flowers, believing that all life and even the cosmos were visible, tangible realities. Their practice was not merely asceticism for its own sake, but a method of harmonizing all things — seeing asceticism not as the denial of self, but as a direct path to understanding it.\\n\\nAnother branch bore heavy fruit, filling the boughs. Scholars of Caprism specialized in the study, breeding, and preservation of animals. The many forms of the chimeras, both pitiful and beautiful, were their small but meaningful experiment to understanding the vast diversity of life.\\n\\nOne branch twisted into a perfect proportion, precise and elegant. The scholars of Nodism asserted that \"all things are numbers,\" believing everything could be mapped mathematically. As one of the earliest schools to form in the Grove, they imposed strict standards, proclaiming \"No scholar who is ignorant of geometry may enter\" and regarded mathematics as the very means by which {RUBY_B#the Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} governs the world.\\n\\nAnother branch grew thick and resilient, sturdy and enduring. Helkolithism required the scholars to prove their discipline by swinging a sling before admission, casting stones beyond a specific range. This was a test to demonstrate their commitment to \"perfectionism\" in thought, physical rigor, and competitive spirit.\\n\\nOne branch alternated between drooping and standing tall, transmitting an exquisite beauty to the senses. The Erythrokeramists view art and sensibility as the core of logical thinking, believing that the rawest and most refined knowledge comes from direct sensory experience, leading to a more enlightened and profound understanding of the world.\\n\\nHigh above, in the lush treetop, one branch devoted and worshipful stood closest to the heart of the giant tree. This branch was the most suited for ritual. The Venerationists excelled in the understanding of Titan ceremonies and the deployment of divine miracles, earning the nickname \"The Cradle of Amphoreus' Politicians.\" They not only governed the Grove's sacred rites but also influenced the very fabric of Amphoreus' politics. However, there was a new and sharp young shoot, rising in opposition...\\n\\nThe Nousporist inherited The First Scholar's teachings on the soul, and specialized in the transformation and ascension of life and matter. It was the youngest school, yet with the most cutting-edge arguments, focused on tracing the origins of all life and material existence.\\n\\nThe Seven Sages of the Seven Schools each presided over their respective fields of study, with no hierarchy among them. The towering giant tree of reason, the symbolic head of the Seven Sages, spread knowledge and reason like branches, scattering them across the world amid endless debates and intellectual discourse."

+"Thalesus, \"The First Scholar,\" embarked on his journey around Amphoreus from his coastal home city, Mileutus, at his age of majority, seeking spiritual meaning within the Mnestia faith.\\n\\nAlong the way, his strange experiences and new visions reshaped his thoughts on nature and the origin of the world. At the journey's end, he met the \"Bough of Rift\" and completed his philosophical methods to experience the world before the great tree. Under the giant tree, Thalesus established a courtyard and named it the Grove of Epiphany, a place for people to awaken their spirits, seek wisdom, and grasp the way.\\n\\nThe thoughts of {RUBY_B#the Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} became so enhanced that they became written scrolls or quietly turned into the whispering flora of the grove... The noise of the Grove was born from there. From these debates and intellectual exchanges, new schools of thought emerged.\\n\\nAlthough differentiated from one another, the schools were interwoven — much like the overlaying branches of the giant tree... Through centuries of argument and scholarly heritage, The First Scholar's insights have evolved into the Seven Sages and seven primary schools of thought, as well as many different viewpoints.\\n\\n\"All knowledge of the world should become the leaves of the Grove, to shield the sun and help the giant tree flourish.\" Every city-state seeking wisdom from the Grove must offer equal knowledge in return. Thus, countless ideas are nourished, and countless new leaves sprout.\\n\\nFor centuries, should any scrolls containing knowledge be found on trade caravans passing through the Grove's narrow passage or ships arriving at the port, they would become a part of the Grove's library regardless of the scroll's nationality or language. The scholars, or rather, \"bandits,\" transformed the Grove into Amphoreus' best school by ways of spending incomprehensible amounts of wealth on knowledge, hiring copywriters to steal knowledge, or even outright robbery of knowledge. The scholars of the Grove used questions as sacrificial vassals and thoughts as reverence, and bowed their heads at the supreme reason in this world.\\n\\nBeginning with the planting of life, returning to the spirit of the wood, the Grove collects all knowledge that flows to it from the world. {RUBY_B#The Reason Titan}Cerces{RUBY_E#} listened to the growing noise of the Grove, and never spoke."

Once, a parasitized Armed Archaeologist steeled themselves and sliced out larvae from underneath the skin of their arm with a knife in order to deliver data to the Intelligentsia Guild for research purposes.
